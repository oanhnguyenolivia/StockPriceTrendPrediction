<h1>Stock Price Trend Prediction</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on predicting stock price trends. By leveraging datasets from prominent companies like Amazon, Google, and Commonwealth Bank, the project involves data selection and engineered lag features to capture historical patterns. It explores different Recurrent Neural Network models, including vanilla RNN, Gated Recurrent Unit, and Long Short-Term Memory, aiming to identify the model with the lowest Root Mean Square Error scores. The goal is to provide a predictive analysis tool for understanding potential trends in stock prices based on historical data and temporal dependencies.
